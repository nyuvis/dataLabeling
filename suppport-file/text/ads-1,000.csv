"25812448641835288","Right now as you read this, you are currently CONSUMING content. But how much content are you CREATING? 

When you consume content, you lose time and money. But when you create AND share content you can save time and make money!

But you have to know THE RIGHT content to create and share…

To attract people you must be visible. The old way was to create SALES content (such as brochures, sales letters and promotions). 

Today you MUST create EDUCATIONAL content.

When you do this well you can turn your passion into a profit AND create a business doing what you love and a lifestyle you’ll love even more.

To turn YOUR passion into a profit FIRST read these 9 fundamental truths…

Truth No.1
The knowledge, knowhow and experience you have acquired to date is a valuable asset. There are people in the world right now, with money in hand ready to learn how to do what you can already do.

Truth No.2
Everything that happened in your life (good or bad) has happened for a reason. Your experiences have gifted you a unique empathy with people who are facing what you faced. You are now perfectly positioned to help them and be a source of information and inspiration. 

Truth No.3
If you have overcome the pain of failure, rejection or loss, in your personal or professional life you will have learnt valuable lessons. These lessons can be ‘packaged’ into helpful advice in the forms of articles, posts, blogs, books, home study programs, podcasts, online videos, webinars and workshops. 

Truth No.4
There is an ever-growing number of Freelancers, Advisors, Consultants, Coaches, Therapists, Practitioners, Mentors, Experts, Speakers, Trainers and Seminar Leaders who are going from a total unknown to expert, from expert to an authority, and from an authority to a celebrity in their industry or niche.

Truth No.5
The world has changed and you no longer need to be skilled and experienced and forever allow an employer to capitalise on that knowledge and wisdom whilst you get paid a fraction of what they are making out of you.

Truth No.6
You are living in the information age where it is possible to deliver AND offer your knowhow and expertise online, on a stage or on the small screen of your computer through email, social media and your website.

Truth No.7 
You can reach thousands if not millions of people with your advice and “how to” information and make a really good living helping other people to get ahead or overcome a personal or professional problem.

Truth No.8 
You don’t need to be qualified, certified or have letters after your name. Your qualification is your life experiences, your passion for helping others and your determination to make a difference

Truth No.9
You can do this, even if right now you’re not sure how. (I’ll show you)

My name is Andy Harrington and I am the author of the Sunday Times bestselling book Passion Into Profit and I’m inviting you (right now in this post) to a very special one-day seminar (FOR FREE) where I will be teaching the concepts that took me from a wannabe to a headline performer at some of the biggest arenas in the world like The London o2 Arena and Wembley (with the likes of Richard Branson, Tony Robbins, Bill Clinton, and Steve Wozniak the Co-Founder of Apple to name but a few)

At this FREE one-day seminar I will show you a model for designing, developing and delivering your unique content in the form of Info Products (such as Audio’s. Video and Audio Visual). Seminars, Workshops, Advanced Teaching Courses, Preview events, Bootcamps and of course Sunday Times and Amazon bestselling books…!

At this one-day event I will show you how you can become an authority in ANY subject you wish (even if you are just starting out) within just a few months…!

Tickets have (just a few moments ago) become available for my LONDON date and if you are a quick decision maker you’ll be able to secure one for you AND a friend or colleague right now. (they’ll love you for it)

Please note tickets are already being snapped up rapidly and will run out.

""When I campaigned for governor eight years ago, I promised “A Better Minnesota.” By many measures, we have made important progress, but there is still more work to be done. In November’s general election, Minnesotans will be faced with a clear choice: Do we want to move forward or go backward?

""For everyone who wants to move ahead, Erin Murphy will provide the best possible leadership to establish and achieve new goals, to overcome unforeseeable obstacles and to bring all of us together rather than tear us apart. After all of the campaign promises, the success of a governor depends upon the person. I urge all of us to ask ourselves: Whom can we most trust to hold true their principles, values and convictions? Who has the vision for the best Minnesota we can be? And who has the most clearly proven record of leadership and achievement in state government?

""By those standards, I strongly believe that Erin Murphy will be the best governor to lead the nationally recognized “Best State in the Nation” to even greater future successes. Please join me in voting for Erin Murphy for governor in the Aug. 14 primary.""

"6647517208603787","🔴 Due to the COVID-19 Quarantine, Hundreds of Thousands of People are Getting Laid Off Left and Right... 🔴

In Times Like This, Many People are Going to Experience Hardship in Many Aspects of Life.

It’s Only a Matter of Time Before the Foreclosures Start Stacking Up. 

Real Estate Prices Will Plunge, The Media Will Start Talking About How Bad the Market is and Investors WIll Start Running Away From Real Estate Like they Did During the Crash of 2008.  

I believe it’s Our God Given Duty to Use Our Knowledge and Our Skillset to Help People in this Time of Need. 

As an Active Investor for 16 Years, I’ve Successfully Navigated Through the Good, The Bad, and the Ugly. (It may surprise which one is the most profitable part of the cycle) 

HINT: It’s the coming part of the cycle that you need to be prepared for so you can set yourself up for the rest of your life.

My MISSION is to Help a Million People Become Financially Free Thru Real Estate and I Want You to Be One of Them. 

Because of the Corona Virus Quarantine, the big bad iBuyers like Zillow, Redfin and OpenDoor have already stopped buying houses...which means the big bad bullies of house buying are gone...which means less competition and more deals for us. 

The reality is you should be running toward real estate right now and not away from it. 

This is a huge mistake new investors make when the market starts to decline and I will do everything I can help you understand that. 

The reality is... down real estate markets is when inexperienced investors get scared and run away and the educated investors stick around and scoop up all the incredible deals that become available. 
 
This is the same thing that happened in the crash of 2008. 

The smart investors stayed in, got educated, and built incredible portfolios by buying properties as low as 10-30 cents on the dollar. 

Which is why I’m giving away my Virtual Real Estate Mini Course for anyone interested in using their quarantine time wisely to learn and implement virtual real estate investing to set yourself up for the rest of your life. 

Virtual Real Estate Investing is the Perfect Strategy Right Now Because You Can Do Deals Without Risking Your Own Cash and You Don’t Need to Leave Your House because You Can Do this Completely Virtual.

You now basically have zero competition because real estate agents are too afraid to go into someone else’s house right now…and rightfully so…

I wouldn’t want to go into a stranger’s house either which is why I’m going to show you how to do this 100% virtually from your house or from anywhere.

The best part is... you don’t need to meet anyone in person (so no risk to you or your loved ones) and you can do all of this from your laptop from anywhere.

This allows you to virtually buy real estate just like buying stocks. 

Also, you don’t need any capital to get started which makes it very low risk to get started. You don’t even need to borrow capital with this strategy.

I Urge You to STOP Watching the News and Start Studying How to Become Financially Secure Without Relying on a Job or the Government.

"6203702766339094","I want a Penzeys in my town!

Our second ever Penzeys contest! The rules are pretty simple. We promise to open a store in whatever community in the US with a metro population of 350,000 or more that gets the most people to sign up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking email list By March 31, 2019.

To sign up, just click this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/I-Want-a-Penzeys.html  All you need to enter is your email address and your zip code if you want a Penzeys in your town. We will send you a conformation email, and to make your vote official you just need to open the email. It’s pretty easy. 

If you are in a smaller community, or already have a Penzeys in your town, you can still vote for where you would like to see our next store by clicking on any one of the 106 possible locations. Yes, this also means you can encourage everyone you know from around the country to sign up and vote for your town.

Our stores really do have an amazing way of setting both tasty meals and better futures in motion. Wherever we open, good things follow. That’s not so much us, that’s you. There is an amazing power to the kindness of Cooks; to be where they gather never fails to brighten even the gloomiest of days. And in these times where some are trying to push the politics of fear, our stores are a great reminder that real strength comes not from driving others away, but from gathering everyone around the table. Cooks Heal the World, and a big part of that is by creating a community of caring that really does make a difference. Help us celebrate the kindness of cooking in your town.

And rest assured, as much as this is a contest, and as much as we do promise to deliver a Penzeys Store to whatever area has the most signups, we are still Penzeys. We are not doing this to punish the second place finisher or even the sixth. We want to know where we are wanted, but at the same time we also want to be where we are needed. Your words mean a great deal to us. In the comments below please feel free to put in a pitch for a community that may not get the numbers to win, but would still be the right spot for us to be. We promise to be open to what you write.

Together we can make the world a better place by spreading the incredible value in caring for each other one store at a time. Please share this with friends and family and encourage them to do the same. And remember, to make your vote official you need to open the confirmation email we send right after you sign up. Unlike some, we want every vote counted :)

Once again, here’s that link. Don’t put this off, click now: http://spices.penzeys.com/I-Want-a-Penzeys.html

Just because you raise a tax does not mean you can count on the tax revenue!. 

Under BC's Fair PharmaCare the maximum amount a lower income Islander with no benefit plan (earning more than $14,000 and less than $32,000) pays for medicine is between $100-$900/year and the maximum amount someone earning $108,000/year is $4,000.

"5247898275333549","Pictured behind these two fine lads is an unnamed tributary to Whetstone Run. Both streams course their way across the Don Guanella property. The unnamed tributary is so pristine that the Darby Creek Valley Association petitioned PA's Department of Environmental Protection in 2016 to upgrade its classification from ""warm water fishery"" to ""high quality,"" a technical designation which provides the stream with greater protections against any degradation of any sort, including development. 

If you recall, Pope Francis issued an encyclical two years ago entitled ""Laudato Si"" which called on all of us to protect ""our common home,"" that is, nature. Perhaps the Archdiocese didn't get the Pope's message because they and Carlino Commercial had their lawyers fight the DCVA's petition to protect this important stream, and their interference has resulted in the DEP preliminary decision to leave the stream's designation the way it is. This is not how the process is supposed to work and DEP's preliminary finding is unacceptable. But you can help DCVA and SMG do something about it. 

Please read Jaclyn Rhoads' Letter to the Editor. She's the president of DCVA and she explains what's wrong with this unscientific decision by DEP.

****

Last year Darby Creek Valley Association (DCVA) petitioned the PA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to change the Water Quality (WQ) designation of an un-named tributary of Whetstone Run in the Darby Creek Watershed to High Quality. This tributary represents the last remaining higher quality stream reaches in our Watershed, but the DEP intends to reject our petition for changing the WQ designation for this creek in Marple Township of Delaware County for reasons that are flawed and will likely pave the way for a large scale development project.

The development project is proposed on 213 acres owned by the Archdioceses of Philadelphia for the past several decades in Marple Township – known as the Don Guanella property. The developer wants to build a commercial complex that is 8 acres larger than the Springfield Mall, and if he doesn’t get zoning relief for this commercial center, will build a large suburban sprawl housing development that will kill the entire forest area. This is not only devastating to one of the largest remaining forest areas in the Darby Creek Watershed in Delaware County, but past development of open space is a known cause of additional flooding and degradation of waterways downstream in the Watershed impacting flood-prone communities like Clifton Heights, Darby, and Eastwick Philadelphia.

Our initial petition was accepted by the State Environmental Quality Board in 2016 which directed PA DEP to conduct a study to evaluate the quality of the stream. The report of the DEP findings was recently released, and it is a bit disconcerting that in the finding document they mention a report prepared by others (a developer’s consultant) but have not provided a copy to DCVA as petitioners, nor is it referenced or an attachment to their findings report. In addition, there was no inclusion of the data that DCVA provided in our petition (3 years of macroinvertebrate data), but DEP would mention a dissenter’s report but not provide equal press for the data that a non-profit provided with the petition.

Not only does DEP report differently on “expert” reports, but DEP also has a flawed process. It compared the tributary to places like Sixpenny Creek which is in Berks County, not too far from Reading, in a limited development area over 50 miles away. There is an exceptional value stream less than 1,000 feet away that should have been used for comparison. DEP also sampled once last November which was early in the Benthos year, still cooling down from such a warm fall, and at a time when the bugs are really tiny, some may not have laid eggs yet or may have been just hatched.

This is the highest functioning stream DCVA has identified in the entire Darby Creek Watershed and losing it due an incorrect Water Quality designation will be a significant loss for the watershed.

It is important for residents throughout Delaware County to understand how this will affect the community and that you can help to reverse this decision. Comments on the draft stream evaluation report are open until Monday, August 13 here: https://www.ahs.dep.pa.gov/eComment/Agreement.aspx?system=2&period=237

Most importantly, people need to reach out to their state representatives to ask the PA Environmental Quality Board to direct DEP to go back and do a proper evaluation of the stream designation petition.

Time is of the essence, so please make your calls by August 13th!

Jaclyn Rhoads, Ph.D.

We are petitioning Crown Council and MLA Doug Routley to ask that the maximum penalty be imposed on Anderson Joe and Melissa Tooshley for their horrific act of animal abuse. If convicted, Joe and Tooshley face a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison, a $10,000 fine and up to a lifetime ban on owning animals.

Happy Monday! It’s been a busy past few weeks in Algona and this last weekend was no exception! 
On Saturday morning, we enjoyed  breakfast at the Algona Noon Kiwanis fundraiser - for their many community projects for kids - including Student of the Month,  bicycle helmets for kids, dictionary distribution in the schools.   
Saturday evening was the KRHC Legacy Ball; it was another festive celebration of our amazing health care professionals and facilities.  Congratulations to Scott Curtis and family for such deserving honors and to the many planners and donors. It’s energizing to support the foundation year after year!  
Sunday afternoon included teamwork and fellowship to install another telescoping flag pole near Wesley - to fly our nation’s colors and support our Kiwanis kids’ projects.    
Together we get amazing things done!  
As all of you know, tomorrow is Election Day, Tuesday, November 5!

One company alone (Energy Transfer Partners) has had 527 spills in 16 years — one every 11 days! One of them spilled 189,000 gallons of oil and contaminated a ten-mile section of Tete Bayou in Louisiana.

At Greenpeace, we’re committed to stopping all new pipeline construction and keeping crude oil in the ground. But we can’t do it without you.

You can help block pipeline construction by becoming a Greenpeace monthly donor. Monthly gifts are a steady resource we rely on to fund the many battles we have to fight — against pipelines, offshore drilling, single-use plastics, and more.
 
Many of our monthly members choose to give in small increments. A gift of as little as $11 a month is invaluable in defeating the multinational oil companies that want to destroy the planet in the name of increased profit.

Pipelines ravage environments, pollute land, endanger wildlife, poison drinking water, and increase fossil fuel use, which accelerates climate change.","2018-08-22","2018-08-22",NULL,"5435784683","USD","engage.us.greenpeace.org","","Yes, I Want to Donate!","https://www.facebook.com/ads/archive/render_ad/?id=4511265369158627&access_token=271036207024410%7Cuyb9rZmfzXkojISiZGxQ-BE97Fo","Greenpeace USA"

We have sponsored the sheep section and will be there judging the lambs from around 10am onwards so please say hello. We will also be welcoming John Cookson and his plus 1 (our competition winners), to the members' section to meet our suppliers. 

There will also be a Lamb2ewe stand in the countryside tent and Tom and Jack will be there throughout the day to meet you and talk about all things Lamb2ewe and farming. Ewe will also be able to place orders with us on the stand and we will have some great offers available.

Saturday will also see us announce some HUGE news that we're just bursting to tell ewe. So stay tuned for that. 
Hopefully, we will also be able to bring you a couple of live streams so look out for those and feel free to put in requests for what you'd like to see as well as being able to ask us questions. 

See y'all real soon

"4467287459964205","YOU DID THIS: ""This council will not do anything to people’s guns. We will not try to take someone’s guns from them.”

Thanks to pressure from citizens in Pickens County, the county council was forced to repeal unconstitutional language in their emergency laws.

While there's more work to do, Pickens County restored their 2nd Amendment right to defend themselves and their families.

Here's the old language that residents forced County Council to eliminate from the code of laws: 

""Suspend or limit the sale, dispensing or transportation of alcoholic beverages, firearms, explosives and combustibles or other hazardous materials."" (Sec: 2-531, D-8)

During this unprecedented time, local politicians are taking rights and power that doesn't belong to them. 

It's up to us to make sure that they don't.

Text the word GUARD to the number 52886 on your cell phone. 

That will send a direct message to your local politicians asking if they've passed an emergency declaration. Does it mess with our God-given, constitutional rights? And if it does, it needs to be repealed.

GUARD to 52886.

"4361210863920990","It is always a treat to visit schools in the constituency. Today was  no exception I was at the Easington Colliery Primary School, the biggest primary school in County Durham with over 570 children, and also one of the best and most nurturing schools in East Durham. On Monday coming a group of year 6 pupils from Easington Primary are in London visiting  Parliament and before it was dissolved for the snap General Election, I had planned to meet the group and give them a guided tour. Sorry I can’t be there on Monday, but I am sure the Parliament Education Unit will do a great job with the tour. This is an inspirational group of children who have a social consolation and far greater awareness of political issues like climate change that I never had at their age and it fills me with hope for the future. It was great to meet the excellent Head Teacher Miss Beverley Jones and teaching and support staff who gave me a tour of the school, and I was so impressed to see the school’s daily record from the day of the Easington Colliery disaster in 1951. I did an assembly about Parliament and then a question and answer session and was put under pressure about the climate change emergency, the environment and why there weren’t proper shelters for homelessness people. I also met and had a discussion with the the School Voice/School Council, all of whom where a credit to themselves the school and their families.

"4303467573011970","🔴 Due to the COVID-19 Quarantine, Hundreds of Thousands of People are Getting Laid Off Left and Right... 🔴

In Times Like This, Many People are Going to Experience Hardship in Many Aspects of Life.

It’s Only a Matter of Time Before the Foreclosures Start Stacking Up. 

Real Estate Prices Will Plunge, The Media Will Start Talking About How Bad the Market is and Investors WIll Start Running Away From Real Estate Like they Did During the Crash of 2008.  

I believe it’s Our God Given Duty to Use Our Knowledge and Our Skillset to Help People in this Time of Need. 

As an Active Investor for 16 Years, I’ve Successfully Navigated Through the Good, The Bad, and the Ugly. (It may surprise which one is the most profitable part of the cycle) 

HINT: It’s the coming part of the cycle that you need to be prepared for so you can set yourself up for the rest of your life.

My MISSION is to Help a Million People Become Financially Free Thru Real Estate and I Want You to Be One of Them. 

Because of the Corona Virus Quarantine, the big bad iBuyers like Zillow, Redfin and OpenDoor have already stopped buying houses...which means the big bad bullies of house buying are gone...which means less competition and more deals for us. 

The reality is you should be running toward real estate right now and not away from it. 

This is a huge mistake new investors make when the market starts to decline and I will do everything I can help you understand that. 

The reality is... down real estate markets is when inexperienced investors get scared and run away and the educated investors stick around and scoop up all the incredible deals that become available. 
 
This is the same thing that happened in the crash of 2008. 

The smart investors stayed in, got educated, and built incredible portfolios by buying properties as low as 10-30 cents on the dollar. 

Which is why I’m giving away my Virtual Real Estate Mini Course for anyone interested in using their quarantine time wisely to learn and implement virtual real estate investing to set yourself up for the rest of your life. 

Virtual Real Estate Investing is the Perfect Strategy Right Now Because You Can Do Deals Without Risking Your Own Cash and You Don’t Need to Leave Your House because You Can Do this Completely Virtual.

You now basically have zero competition because real estate agents are too afraid to go into someone else’s house right now…and rightfully so…

I wouldn’t want to go into a stranger’s house either which is why I’m going to show you how to do this 100% virtually from your house or from anywhere.

The best part is... you don’t need to meet anyone in person (so no risk to you or your loved ones) and you can do all of this from your laptop from anywhere.

This allows you to virtually buy real estate just like buying stocks. 

Also, you don’t need any capital to get started which makes it very low risk to get started. You don’t even need to borrow capital with this strategy.

I Urge You to STOP Watching the News and Start Studying How to Become Financially Secure Without Relying on a Job or the Government.   

I am Completely Unemployable!

After Getting Turned Down for Every Job I Applied for Like Enterprise Rent a Car and Home Depot, I Have Been My Own Boss for the Past 16 years. 

I Racked up $109,000 in Credit Card Debt Until I Figured Out Virtual Real Estate Investing. 

I’ll Show You How I Did it So You Can Copy Exactly What I Did.

"4298497723501112","Growing up in rural Oregon, I know what it’s like to feel far from power and how difficult it is to make your voice heard. This can be especially true for communities that have traditionally been shut out from the systems, institutions, and discourse that shape our outcomes. That is why I’m so proud to be endorsed by one of the most influential voices for farmworkers and Latinx families in the state: PCUN Farmworkers and Latinx Working Families United.

Especially as COVID-19 is impacting public health, how we work, and how many of us navigate fundamental aspects of security, PCUN’s community activism and support is especially critical for members of the Latinx and farmworker community throughout Oregon. This week, Martha Sonato, PCUN’s Political Director, spoke with me to discuss how workers are calling for action while confronting substantial stress and anxiety.

Unfortunately about one week after a video of his daring rescue surfaced Lewis died in a local koala hospital after receiving intensive treatment.

The fires that have devastated over 42,000,000 acres of koala habitat. Australia and its ecosystems will have a long and difficult way to restore what was lost.

The blazes have cost thousands of koala lives and other animals and trees native to Australia leaving many local species dangerously close to the endangered species list.

"4287913074567919","One of the things I would like to see Delaware County do is to continue pushing green energy alternatives whenever possible to reduce our carbon footprint. County government has a lot of buildings & vehicles & I think that we could explore some creative ways to power those buildings and vehicles. First, I would like to see solar panels on the roofs of every single county building. This would make a tremendous impact both financially & environmentally. Also there may be some opportunities for green roofs in certain locations along with pourous concrete to help with drainage and runoff. The new county jail could have solar panels on the roof along with geothermal heating & cooling or even solar panels outside on the ground filling up some of the vast areas that would need mowed. There are grants available to offset costs and these improvements would pay themselves very quickly in utility costs saved. Some of the money saved & later generated could even later be allocated for hybrid electric county police cruisers. There’s a lot more that can be done and just heating & cooling our county buildings with geothermal heat/air conditioning & rooftop solar panels would go a long way. I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on improving Delaware County’s carbon footprint.","2020-04-08","2020-04-08","2020-04-10","105557940990671","USD",NULL,NULL,NULL,"https://www.facebook.com/ads/archive/render_ad/?id=4287913074567919&access_token=EAACXDBbQm8kBAApfkxZADSU9fKfUxbW3ltcEDYmN6OMcvsgClO0NVGkWmULB7X9zjeEfT0NWUjY9w5ufNn2nc8BPi5BNdIAef3sA8sXKI2nViGYo5EZCp07akMfZA7BrGmnbwRFmjOpWmdAkh6eje9232ZAkqzBVx9ejjf4d6fLwaaRDxGrN3gQa99n9ZC9ZCyobHs4vIRFQZDZD","Ryan Scott Webb"

"4287710767913633","Get Kentucky Back To Work!

For four weeks many Kentucky businesses that are considered non-essential by the executive branch have been forced to close their doors.  The result is that to date over 500,000 Kentuckians have filed for unemployment and $3.4 billion has been approved for Payroll Protection Program loans for Kentucky small businesses.

There is a great fear that many of these jobs are permanently lost and that many small businesses will not survive.

To mitigate the damage the executive branch must swiftly execute a well managed and aggressive approach to get Kentucky back to work.

1. Be proactive.  Make restarting the economy the number one priority.  Social distancing and healthy at home are working, the curve is flattening.  It’s time to focus on restarting the economy.

2. Be consumer friendly.  Mitigate economic losses by reforming Kentucky tax policy.  Enact policies and legislation to ease the tax burden on consumers and small businesses.

3. Be smart.  The shutdown was total and across the board.  Reopening the economy can be done in stages.  

4. Be safe.  There are strategies that will allow the healthy to get back to work while protecting the vulnerable.","2020-04-15","2020-04-15","2020-04-20","304932286223451","USD",NULL,NULL,NULL,"https://www.facebook.com/ads/archive/render_ad/?id=4287710767913633&access_token=EAACXDBbQm8kBADin06orcYFM7Wrd9xBVKdse37dCcIhuX2oZBt1ymegZBXDB6UXX5BYTXZBzEva8yxZBMpz6YZAMUouEHCrERvyeMmz5QSAu9ykrlLUily7xlml6MJiU5dmG5yhJAOKQpn6mi8tQ6Lg6bZAkcUESIyrynfRsUx7ZBJNgPYeYfAgHHe6QjRn6SoVHN43dZAJZBLwZDZD","Mark F.

"4280657988614868","👉 A HUGE opportunity is coming…

The question is...will you be ready for it?

I want to share a story with you that’s a perfect analogy for the current state of the world.

When someone is learning to surf, they often wait for the wave to be underneath them before they start paddling. 🌊 

Even if they paddle as fast as they can to catch up to the wave, it’s almost always too late.

An experienced surfer knows that to catch a wave, you have to start paddling before the wave is underneath you. 👊

Opportunities in life work the same way.

When a wave of opportunity is headed your way, you have to start paddling (preparing) before it gets to you if you want to ride it. 👍

Imagine for just a moment what it would have been like to “catch the wave” and invest when McDonalds or Subway first started⁉

Or if you were able to invest in stocks at the bottom of the dot com crash⁉

Or if you were able to buy as much property as Trump bought in the real estate slump of the 70’s⁉

The people who rode those waves made a fortune.

Trump’s Manhattan real estate he bought in the 70’s has now increased 6000% in value. 😲

But most people were unprepared when the wave came, or too full of fear to invest.

Well, guess what…

...the next wave of opportunity is coming, and it’s a big one.
There’s a pandemic, the world is shutting down, economies are grinding to a halt and stock markets are plummeting.

What are most people doing? Panicking.👎

Millions of people who don’t know what to do and don’t know how to manage their emotions are glued to social media with their lifetime supply of toilet paper.

What are smart people doing? Paddling. 👍

✔ A small fraction of people (less than 3%) are busy preparing to catch the next big wave of opportunity. (Are you one of them?)

✔ NOW is the time to prepare. That’s the mindset highly successful people have.

✔ NOW is the time to upgrade your knowledge and your skills. 

 ✔ NOW is the time to create a plan and put it into action so you can “catch the wave”.

✔ NOW is the time to start taking a home-based business seriously so you don’t need to rely on a job or the government for your financial future or your family’s livelihood.

✔ NOW is the time to use your quarantine time wisely and start generating income from home from a business that provides more opportunity to do really well while helping people at the same time.

"4267337829958657","La vraie ‘‘force cachée’’ du Coronavirus COVID – 19

Fin d’un cycle de l’existence humaine et Mort d’une civilisation

Le début d’une ‘‘autre’’ Humanité vivante

‘‘À la civilisation de masse doit succéder une civilisation à l’échelle de l’individu.’’ Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, président de la République Française (1974 – 1976), Lyon, 23 avril 1981

Par Joël Asher Lévy-Cohen *

L’année 2020 peut se prononcer comme le nombre deux mille vingt. Elle peut aussi s’écrire et se prononcer de la manière suivante : ‘‘deux mille vins’’. À cet égard, elle rappellerait ce fameux breuvage qui délecte le palais des dieux, ravit les papilles gustatives divines. Aussi rappellerait-elle cette boisson magique qui rend de temps en temps les hommes dingues.

Oui ‘‘Deux mille vins’’ ! Le nouveau millésime est sans aucun doute frelaté au point de rendre les humains fous, vraiment fous. Au point de rendre le monde loufoque. Au point de perdre complètement la raison. Ce qui revient à dire et même à conclure péremptoirement que l’humanité s’est, en ce début 2020, bien réveillée avec la gueule de bois.

En effet, l’année 2020 n’a commencé qu’avec de très mauvaises nouvelles. Celle-ci a démarré en trombe avec des informations aux allures apocalyptiques. La belle Australie, sise aux confins du monde, a ouvert le bal des actualités alarmantes avec moult incendies. Ces feux de forêt d’origine manifestement criminelle ont décimé tout l’écosystème forestier et animalier.

Ces incendies meurtriers ont détruit un vrai bijou de la nature. Force est de constater que celui-ci a pris des millions d’années pour se constituer et se pérenniser. Aussi ces feux de forêt ont-ils ravagé l’habitat des animaux autant que celui des humains. Ils ont ainsi rendu pauvres des centaines de gens ou des milliers de familles.

Après le drame australien, l’humanité a bel et bien frôlé la catastrophe en raison de la tension politique et diplomatique qui oppose de manière persistante les États-Unis d’Amérique et l’Iran sur la question brûlante du dossier nucléaire. Cette crise a, ostensiblement, atteint son paroxysme, culminé avec l’assassinat du général iranien Qassem Soleimani à Baghdâd par des drones américains. Ce polémarque, à plus forte raison architecte de la politique belliciste iranienne, coiffait, en réalité, la tête des forces Al-Qods du Corps des gardiens de la révolution islamique. 

Si elle n’est certes pas résolue de manière pacifique et non violente, cette crise aux multiples rebondissements pourrait indubitablement occasionner des ravages indicibles. Elle pourrait naturellement provoquer des dommages irréparables sur l’ensemble de la région du Proche-Orient ou du Moyen-Orient. Cela dit, l’option militaire demeure, pour l’instant, la seule sur la table de divers états-majors des pays intéressés ou concernés de loin ou de près. Il y a lieu de noter que celle-ci est, sans équivoque, normalement privilégiée dans la seule et unique optique de redessiner complètement voire profondément la cartographie politique du Grand Moyen-Orient.

Avant même d’avoir assisté à une baisse significative de tension entre le pays de l’Oncle Sam et l’empire théocratique des Mollahs, le coronavirus COVID – 19 s’est finalement auto-invité. Depuis la Chine engluée durant des semaines et des mois dans une crise interminable avec la province rebelle de Hong-Kong, ce virus s’est faufilé, sans tambour ni trompette, entre ‘‘la procédure judiciaire de l’Impeachment’’ visant directement le locataire de la Maison Blanche Donald John Trump Sr et le ‘‘Megxit’’ qui irritait au plus haut point les Sujets de sa Gracieuse Majesté. Sans compter que le Coronavirus a volé la vedette aux primaires démocrates dont l’envol, d’ailleurs, chaotique et combiné aux déboires, quoi que vite limités, du vieux routier Joe Biden, est très nettement passé au second plan dans la majorité des médias de masse.

Ce qui est absolument clair, le Coronavirus COVID – 19 a véritablement décidé de se faire parler de lui. Peu importe en bien ou en mal. En mal, il sied de noter que ce virus opportuniste a été décrété rien de moins qu’un ennemi à abattre par des gouvernements et des États. À cet effet, celui-ci a été assimilé non pas à un simple ‘‘agent pathogène’’ mais plutôt à ‘‘un agent du terrorisme international’’. Donc un ennemi public N0 1 sur le plan ‘‘médical’’ et ‘‘sanitaire’’ mais combattu avec des ressources militaires, des moyens sécuritaires d’un État disposant du monopole de la violence légitime au sein de la société...

Vu son statut ultra-contagieux, ce vecteur a visiblement nécessité une coopération soudée, une collaboration étroite et sans faille entre États et gouvernements de la planète Terre. Dans ce domaine, le plus bel exemple de solidarité demeure sans nul doute l’assistance ‘‘médicale’’ et ‘‘humanitaire’’ de la Chine pour aider directement l’Italie à endiguer cette crise sanitaire et des pays africains au cas où cette pandémie prendrait soudainement des proportions inquiétantes dans leur sphère géographique. Force est de relever que l’Italie qui est, bien sûr, un État membre de l’Union européenne (UE), est réellement un des pays les plus touchés par la propagation ultrarapide de ce virus mortel. 

En bien, le Coronavirus COVID – 19 a suscité la prise des mesures draconiennes dont la plus emblématique est, à coup sûr, le confinement des individus ou familles. Même s’il est réputé porter atteinte à la liberté, cet isolement des personnes participe positivement à la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre en raison de l’anémie de la production industrielle. Aussi participe-t-il, en restreignant la libre circulation des automobiles ou des véhicules motorisés, à la diminution drastique de la pollution. En vérité, celle-ci est occasionnée par des voitures qui émettent du plomb censé contaminer l’environnement humain voire des particules fines  qui vicient l’air et, par voie de conséquence, entraînent l’explosion des maladies respiratoires telles que l’asthme. 

Sur le plan électronique, le Coronavirus COVID – 19 qui nécessite plus que jamais l’isolement des individus pour éviter toute contamination interhumaine favorise à tout bout de champ le télétravail. À ce niveau, il chamboule complètement l’organisation du travail, d’une part. Et, d’autre part, il bouleverse le mode de vie des employés au sein de l’entreprise.

Le support informatique jumelé au téléphone devient, ainsi, le seul moyen de contact et, surtout, de communication ‘‘interpersonnelle’’ entre l’employeur et les employés. Comme les rencontres ‘‘personnelles’’ sont, en réalité, réduites au maximum, il sert normalement à planifier des réunions d’affaires. Aussi sert-il à commander autant des victuailles auprès des hypermarchés ou supermarchés que des médicaments auprès des pharmacies, des biens de consommation courante auprès des quincailleries. 

En d’autres termes, ce virus opportuniste vient de faire basculer toute une civilisation fondée sur les contacts personnels. En effet, cet agent pathogène, d’ailleurs, réputé pour sa nocivité ou sa virulence vient de faire entrer de plein fouet l’être humain dans l’ère du numérique. Une ère profondément axée sur des contacts virtuels. Une ère dans laquelle les êtres humains condamnés à l’isolement forcé n’éprouvent aucun besoin de se rencontrer personnellement pour partager, discuter, échanger, travailler, jouer, étudier, boire, manger ensemble, etc. 

Cette ère du virtuel accentue en fait l’individualisme au détriment du communautarisme. Elle provoque le phénomène de retrait ou de repli sur soi. Il s’agit d’une ère qui favorise en réalité la vie monacale. Quoi que les moines ayant marqué la vie des communautés médiévales sont, de nos jours, pratiquement une espèce en voie de totale disparition. Cette extinction de la vie monastique est, certes, perceptible aussi bien dans les prieurés que les abbayes en raison du peu de vocation ou du peu d’attrait que suscite franchement ce mode de vie on ne peut plus particulier.

Ce qui est sûr et certain, le Coronavirus COVID – 19 a complètement métamorphosé la façon de vivre de l’être humain. Et en si peu de temps ! Ce virus a profondément modifié sa manière de communiquer avec son prochain. Cet agent pathogène a littéralement modifié sa manière de le saluer. De tout temps, celle-ci consiste à serrer toujours la main de son interlocuteur ou de son vis-à-vis. D’ailleurs, le fait de serrer les pinces traduit la transmission des énergies positives entre deux êtres vivants. Il symbolise la paix et la communion entre deux individus.

À ce propos, il importe de souligner que le Coronavirus COVID – 19 a rejeté dans la mode de salutation les bisous. En effet, les baisers sur la joue à titre d’embrassade ont vraiment pour nature de prouver tout comme de renforcer la proximité ‘‘amicale’’, la fusion ‘‘fraternelle’’ ou ‘‘sororale’’. De même que les petits bécots affectueux sur les lèvres attestent assurément de l’intimité relationnelle, de même les baisers avec la langue témoignent, à n’en point douter, de la proximité amoureuse, de la chimie entre deux tourtereaux. Force est de constater que cette manière d’exprimer publiquement son amour ou de démontrer toute son affection n’est pratiquement plus de mise par les temps qui courent. C’est à vrai dire un changement radical.

Puisque l’humanité verse dans l’ère de la radicalité, il n’est pas du tout rare, aujourd’hui, de voir les êtres humains se joindre successivement à titre d’accolade l’intérieur des deux pieds – en l’occurrence droite contre droite et gauche contre gauche – pour se saluer. Cette attitude comportementale leur permet d’éviter tous azimuts la transmission du virus par la main qui n’en est pas moins un vecteur. Tout comme il n’est pas rare de voir les humains adopter la posture de salutation bouddhiste qui consiste à joindre les deux mains tournées vers le ciel ou le haut. 

Force est de mentionner que cette forme de salutation on ne peut plus originale est sacrée. Elle relève de la spiritualité. Elle dérive de la très haute sagesse. Elle traduit, en fait, le respect de son prochain et l’humilité de l’être vis-à-vis de la Nature et de la Providence. Il y a lieu de remarquer que celle-ci est très en vogue dans divers pays d’Asie . D’ailleurs, cette manière de saluer présente, en vérité, cette particularité et cette singularité d’empêcher tout contact physique des mains.

Chose certaine, le Coronavirus COVID – 19 a indéniablement forcé la fermeture des usines manufacturières, condamnant ainsi à l’arrêt momentané ou à l’interruption plus ou moins longue la production industrielle. Aussi a-t-il forcé la fermeture des entreprises œuvrant dans le domaine de la distribution de divers produits manufacturés. Ce qui fait naturellement craindre la rupture tous azimuts des stocks après d’une clientèle déjà totalement inquiète et, surtout, terrorisée par la perspective de manquer des biens de consommation courante.

En raison de sa nocivité et de la rapidité de transmission interhumaine, ce virus a conduit à la fermeture rapide des églises et temples, crèches, écoles, bibliothèques, aéroports, gares routières et même ferroviaires, stations de métro, cinémas, théâtres, restaurants, arénas de sport, etc. Bref il a entraîné la fermeture autant des services publics et administratifs que des commerces du détail ou du gros. Ce qui fait inéluctablement craindre le net ralentissement ou la paralysie de l’activité économique suivie rapidement d’une très forte dépression. Avec tout ce que cela suppose ou comporte en termes d’effets pervers. Ce qui n’est pas du tout de nature à rassurer le commun mortels. 

Chose certaine, le Coronavirus COVID – 19 a provoqué la panique ou la psychose auprès du grand public. C’est un fait indéniable. L’être humain n’a jamais été aussi inquiet que terrorisé, aussi méfiant que replié sur lui-même. 

Toutefois, cette atmosphère morose amènera-t-elle l’espèce humaine à vivre davantage en autarcie ? La poussera-t-elle à se recroqueviller davantage sur elle-même ? Cette ambiance sinistrose la conduira-t-elle à se singulariser davantage ? L’empêchera-t-elle véritablement de se communautariser à l’avenir ? Lui permettra-t-elle d’inventer par conséquent d’autres liens de familiarité ou modes de sociabilité, d’autres réseaux de fraternité ou de solidarité ?
Ce qui est résolument clair, les voies sont déjà pavées d’avance dans l’ère du numérique. Bien entendu, la persistance virulente du Coronavirus COVID – 19 favorisant le cloisonnement des individus et des familles ne fait rien qu’accélérer cette tendance au suicide de l’humanité ambiante…

Ce qui est sûr, face à l’ampleur macabre prise par le Coronavirus COVID – 19, le 21e siècle très nettement influencé par le numérique sera-t-il religieux ou pas  ? Face à la catastrophe et à l’adversité que représente cette pandémie, l’humain deviendra-t-il un être spirituel ou mystique ?

"4255103204515797","SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT - My opponent and her supporters are making the claim that the city gave away tax dollars for the new Key West style project on Main St and 2nd Ave. The truth is we REFUNDED approximately $180,000 of parkland and tree mitigation fees that the builder paid to the city in exchange for getting them to make multiple concessions the code did not require and to provide the city multiple things of value in return, which total a lot more than the refund the builder received. It is either an effort to intentionally mislead residents or a complete lack of understanding of the deal that would cause someone make this claim. Below are some of the many highlights of what the city received. I should note that just the monetary value of the additional parking spaces alone exceeds the amount refunded.

-  30 brick parking spaces dedicated to the city valued between $175,000 and $475,000.
-  Three new restaurants (the builder was allowed to have all offices with no retail or restaurants).
-  Three new substantial oak trees on 2nd Ave N, each with custom root stabilization systems recommended by the city arborist costing $20,000.
-  22% reduction in maximum height for the residential building.
-  11% reduction in maximum height for the commercial building.
-  60% increase in setback on 2nd St North.
-  110% increase in setback on 2nd Ave North.
-  An architecturally beautiful new building on what was once a dusty vacant piece of land in the heart of our downtown.

In addition, the city will receive annual CRA taxes from the project estimated to be between $55,000 and $75,000. As you can see, when you look at the total agreement the city comes out way ahead from a monetary perspective, from a design & scale perspective, from a parking perspective, and from a quality of life perspective.","2020-02-15","2020-02-15","2020-02-23","1590188981214917","USD",NULL,NULL,NULL,"https://www.facebook.com/ads/archive/render_ad/?id=4255103204515797&access_token=EAAhZBQYQVMRMBAMso0s3yKiWOLJDd6YhYI8hZBSxBnhAfZAp7DaUGOGpSgJiPzVjaLygZCpzqVrVZAEiKnoNAJIcfIhSOGhLVO3qREeFMxlB0O4YnOsFtxFVXRWyY5JbnKEsgQqQBONG2VbAQdZCGxCObz2qJxOksZD","Joe Ayoub Campaign"

"4252446638114544","🛑 Things are changing quickly, and now due to Covid-19, pretty much everyone has been forced to react. 🛑
 
Last night we put on a live web class on how COVID-19 affects real estate investing and unfortunately most who registered may have been locked out as a result of us hitting our GoToWebinar limits.
 
I’m excited to announce two more live webinars today!
 
During the class, we also gave out a download of our new 2020 Market Report that outlines some pretty key insights for anyone who’s interested in things like:

✅  How real estate hedge funds & private lenders are 
        repositioning.      (We have a hedge fund manager on the 
        call.)
✅  The NEW top markets to pay attention to
✅  The 3 real estate wealth waves created by COVID-19
✅  The #1 (from home) REI model for this market
✅  How to earn money FASTER than ever
✅  What NOT TO DO. (Overnight many common real estate 
        investing strategies became obsolete.)

This isn't a “doom and gloom” training but I will address a shifting foreclosure market and what this recent steep rise in unemployment will do to traditional investor blueprints.
 
A lot of the information we share is effective immediately so please carve out the time to watch if you’re doing any deals or buying any property in the next 6 months.
 
Thank you for trusting our team to deliver this timely information & bare with us as we try to get as many people on the training as possible today!

"4245168898830445","🔴 Due to the COVID-19 Quarantine, Hundreds of Thousands of People are Getting Laid Off Left and Right... 🔴

In Times Like This, Many People are Going to Experience Hardship in Many Aspects of Life.

It’s Only a Matter of Time Before the Foreclosures Start Stacking Up. 

Real Estate Prices Will Plunge, The Media Will Start Talking About How Bad the Market is and Investors WIll Start Running Away From Real Estate Like they Did During the Crash of 2008.  

I believe it’s Our God Given Duty to Use Our Knowledge and Our Skillset to Help People in this Time of Need. 

As an Active Investor for 16 Years, I’ve Successfully Navigated Through the Good, The Bad, and the Ugly. (It may surprise which one is the most profitable part of the cycle) 

HINT: It’s the coming part of the cycle that you need to be prepared for so you can set yourself up for the rest of your life.

My MISSION is to Help a Million People Become Financially Free Thru Real Estate and I Want You to Be One of Them. 

Because of the Corona Virus Quarantine, the big bad iBuyers like Zillow, Redfin and OpenDoor have already stopped buying houses...which means the big bad bullies of house buying are gone...which means less competition and more deals for us. 

The reality is you should be running toward real estate right now and not away from it. 

This is a huge mistake new investors make when the market starts to decline and I will do everything I can help you understand that. 

The reality is... down real estate markets is when inexperienced investors get scared and run away and the educated investors stick around and scoop up all the incredible deals that become available. 
 
This is the same thing that happened in the crash of 2008. 

The smart investors stayed in, got educated, and built incredible portfolios by buying properties as low as 10-30 cents on the dollar. 

Which is why I’m giving away my Virtual Real Estate Mini Course for anyone interested in using their quarantine time wisely to learn and implement virtual real estate investing to set yourself up for the rest of your life. 

Virtual Real Estate Investing is the Perfect Strategy Right Now Because You Can Do Deals Without Risking Your Own Cash and You Don’t Need to Leave Your House because You Can Do this Completely Virtual.

You now basically have zero competition because real estate agents are too afraid to go into someone else’s house right now…and rightfully so…

I wouldn’t want to go into a stranger’s house either which is why I’m going to show you how to do this 100% virtually from your house or from anywhere.

The best part is... you don’t need to meet anyone in person (so no risk to you or your loved ones) and you can do all of this from your laptop from anywhere.

This allows you to virtually buy real estate just like buying stocks. 

Also, you don’t need any capital to get started which makes it very low risk to get started. You don’t even need to borrow capital with this strategy.

I Urge You to STOP Watching the News and Start Studying How to Become Financially Secure Without Relying on a Job or the Government.   

I am Completely Unemployable!

After Getting Turned Down for Every Job I Applied for Like Enterprise Rent a Car and Home Depot, I Have Been My Own Boss for the Past 16 years. 

I Racked up $109,000 in Credit Card Debt Until I Figured Out Virtual Real Estate Investing. 

I’ll Show You How I Did it So You Can Copy Exactly What I Did.

"4240560345970175","👉 A HUGE opportunity is coming…

The question is...will you be ready for it?

I want to share a story with you that’s a perfect analogy for the current state of the world.

When someone is learning to surf, they often wait for the wave to be underneath them before they start paddling. 🌊 

Even if they paddle as fast as they can to catch up to the wave, it’s almost always too late.

An experienced surfer knows that to catch a wave, you have to start paddling before the wave is underneath you. 👊

Opportunities in life work the same way.

When a wave of opportunity is headed your way, you have to start paddling (preparing) before it gets to you if you want to ride it. 👍

Imagine for just a moment what it would have been like to “catch the wave” and invest when McDonalds or Subway first started⁉

Or if you were able to invest in stocks at the bottom of the dot com crash⁉

Or if you were able to buy as much property as Trump bought in the real estate slump of the 70’s⁉

The people who rode those waves made a fortune.

Trump’s Manhattan real estate he bought in the 70’s has now increased 6000% in value. 😲

But most people were unprepared when the wave came, or too full of fear to invest.

Well, guess what…

...the next wave of opportunity is coming, and it’s a big one.
There’s a pandemic, the world is shutting down, economies are grinding to a halt and stock markets are plummeting.

What are most people doing? Panicking.👎

Millions of people who don’t know what to do and don’t know how to manage their emotions are glued to social media with their lifetime supply of toilet paper.

What are smart people doing? Paddling. 👍

✔ A small fraction of people (less than 3%) are busy preparing to catch the next big wave of opportunity. (Are you one of them?)

✔ NOW is the time to prepare. That’s the mindset highly successful people have.

✔ NOW is the time to upgrade your knowledge and your skills. 

 ✔ NOW is the time to create a plan and put it into action so you can “catch the wave”.

✔ NOW is the time to start taking a home-based business seriously so you don’t need to rely on a job or the government for your financial future or your family’s livelihood.

✔ NOW is the time to use your quarantine time wisely and start generating income from home from a business that provides more opportunity to do really well while helping people at the same time.

👉 If you’d like to be part of the 3% of people who catch the coming wave of opportunity…

I’m On a Mission to Help a Million Americans Become Financially Free and I Want YOU to Be One of Them. 👍

✔ The business I work in is in an industry that has created more millionaires in American history and it’s also the same industry that took President Trump from millionaire to billionaire status. 

✔ What I do is slightly different though because you don’t have to be a billionaire or a millionaire to get started. 😎

✔ As a matter of fact, you can get started with nothing but a laptop and a smart phone. 

So what is it? 

I call it Virtual Real Estate Investing and what’s great is unlike traditional real estate investing, you don’t need any money or credit and it doesn’t matter where you live. 🙏

✅ You do everything “virtually” from anywhere you want. (kitchen, coffee shop, on vacation, by pool, etc) 

I find real estate deals that no one knows about using strategies that don’t require you to put up any money and quickly resell them for a profit and make checks just like this every month. 🙏

You know what the best part is? 

✅ You Can Do This Too! 

and with Trump’s economic policies and the current Interest Rate, there has never been a better time to get in this business than right now!  👊

which is why I made a short training where I share how everything works. 

Simply Click Below and I’ll Send it Right Over. 👇 👇

"4222428617782695","(COVID19) TLDRUpFront: The third of a four-part series as the United States, and the world, begins tipping-over from COVID-19.

Unlike the pandemic or the economy, our forecast of violence is positive with declining rates in 5 of 6 categories.

Please feel free to share this for those who are worried about crime and violence, it may set some minds at ease. And we've already got enough on our plates.
